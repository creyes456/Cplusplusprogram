# Cplusplusprogram
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
# The project was focused on combining two languages, Python and C++ in order to create a program that creates a grocery list.
# This can solve a real world problem by cutting down the time it takes to count items purchased, or eliminating the need to write down a list of all items. 
#
# What did you do particularly well?
# I was able to implement Python functions into the C++ source file well.
# Using python to sort through files reduced the amount of code needed for the program overall.
#
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
# I could have separated the menu function into another cpp file to reduce the code of the source file even more.
# The same goes for the functions to include python. This would make the main program much more efficient and compact.
#
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
# The pieces of code that were most challenging were the python functions for getting input from and writing to files.
# I referenced the book as well as used the suggested w3schools website for reference. I will be adding this to my resouces for future support.
#
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
# The skills of using multiple languages and seeing their benefit to the overall program will be transferrable to future projects.
#
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
# By using inline comments, proper whitespacing, and clean code, I was able to make this program readable and adaptable.
